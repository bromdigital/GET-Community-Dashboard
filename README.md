<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have certain software & frameworks downloaded. Follow these steps to GET it done:
* Download the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/), or at least 16.4.0.
* Open Windows Powershell, your own favourite commandline tool or the Mac equivalent.
* Perform the following command to update npm and its packages: ```npm install npm@latest -g```
* Perform the following commands to install Express, Bootstrap & JQuery:
  * ```npm install express --save```
  * ```npm install bootstrap```
  * ```npm install jquery```

### Windows specific
On Windows, you might need to follow [these steps](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows) to download node-gyp, Python & some VS packages.
Here's what worked for me (Jeronemo):
* Install node-gyp: ```npm install -g node-gyp```
* Download Python 3.10 [via Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-310/9pjpw5ldxlz5).
* Download [Visual Studio packages](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools) as described in the github nodejs link.
* Set the MicroSoft Visual Studio version to 2019: ```npm config set msvs_version 2019```.
  * Do note that this is different from the 2017 mentioned in the article, but during debugging I found this one to be available and not 2017.

### Installation

1. If you don't have a github account yet, [sign up](https://github.com/signup) first.
2. Go to the folder you want the github dashboard (and possible future) projects in, i.e. ```cd C:/Work/Prive```
3. Clone the Dashboard using the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/simonbromfield/GET-Community-Dashboard.git
   ```
4. Go into the project: ```cd GET-Community-Dashboard```, or full path ```cd C:/Work/Prive/GET-Community-Dashboard```
5. The project has a ```package-lock.json``` file containing all necessary dependencies. Download them using ```npm install```. 
   * If this doesn't succeed, you'll have to go on a debugging spree. Start by reading the error message carefully and checking out the specific settings above for hints.
6. You can now start running the project locally using the command ```npm start```
7. If successful, you can now visit the dashboard in your browser by going to http://localhost:3000/.
